# Toy Store Sales & Inventory Dashboard

## Project Objective
This project simulates a data-driven decision-support dashboard for a fictional toy retail chain. The goal is to enable both strategic and operational decision-making using interactive Power BI reports. This dashboard is designed for **potential clients**, **recruiters**, and **hiring managers** who want to see how I translate raw data into actionable business insights.

#### Business Insights:
- Revenue is concentrated in a few categories — potential overdependence
- Certain SKUs sell in high volume but might have thin margins
- Seasonality evident — Q2/Q3 spikes suggest promotional windows

### Page 2: Operational Intelligence — *Margin & Inventory Optimization*

#### KPIs & Visuals:
- **Gross Margin by Product**: Highlights top and bottom 10 products by profit margin
- **Stock Turnover Ratio**: Identifies products that sell fast vs those that stagnate
- **Low-Margin Product Analysis**: Focus on SKUs under 20% margin
- **Overstock Risk View**: Low-margin, low-turnover products visualised for action

#### Business Insights:
- Products like **Playfoam** and **Plush Pony** have high margins but very low sales → need promotion or bundling
- **Rubik's Cube** and **Splash Balls** have fast turnover but low margin → opportunity to revisit pricing
- **Dino Egg** and **Toy Robot** are both low-margin and slow-moving → phase-out candidates
